<p>Here is a diminished chord</p>
<uke-tab value="2323"></uke-tab>

<p>If we move the first note down one fret toward the nut we end up with a Major 7th chord.</p>
<uke-tab value="1323"></uke-tab>

<p>If we move the second note down one fred we get another Major 7th chord</p>

<uke-tab value="2223"></uke-tab>

<p>Moving the third note down has the same result.</p>
<uke-tab value="2313"></uke-tab>

<p>And finally, moving the last note down we get yet another Major 7th chord.</p>
<uke-tab value="2322"></uke-tab>

<p>Isn't that neat?!</p>

<p>Now, let's look back at that first Major 7th chord we got. If we move that chord down until one finger is off the fretboard,
we end up with a familiar chord. That's the E7 chord!</p>

<uke-tab value="1202"></uke-tab>

<p>We'll call this the E7 shape. Where is the E in all this? Why, it's on the
open string, string #2. That's the root of the chord. So, for all chords of this shape, the root will be on the 2nd string and you'll
play it with your index finger.</p>

<p>Quickly try to find a G7 chord! How about an A7?</p>
