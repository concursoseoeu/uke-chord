<h2>Dominant 7th Chords</h2>

<p>Let's start with a diminished chord. You can play this anywhere on the fretboard.</p>
<uke-chord frets="2323"></uke-chord>

<p>If we move the first note down one fret we end up with a Major 7th chord.</p>
<uke-chord frets="1323"></uke-chord>

<p>If we move the second note down one fret we get another Major 7th chord.</p>

<uke-chord frets="2223"></uke-chord>

<p>Moving the third note down has the same result.</p>
<uke-chord frets="2313"></uke-chord>

<p>And finally, moving the last note down we get yet another Major 7th chord.</p>
<uke-chord frets="2322"></uke-chord>

<p>Isn't that neat?! These are four ways to play Major 7th chords.</p>

<p>Now, let's look back at the third chord we got. If we move that chord down until one finger is off the fretboard,
we end up with a familiar chord. That's the E7 chord!</p>

<uke-chord frets="1202" nut name="E7" sub="00R0"></uke-chord>

<p>We'll call this the E7 shape. Where is the E in all this? Why, it's on the
open string, string #2. That's the root of the chord. So, for all chords of this shape, the root will be on the 2nd string and you'll
play it with your index finger.</p>

<p>Quickly try to find a G7 chord using this pattern. How about an A7?</p>

<h2>V7 - I Progressions</h2>
<p>The Major 7th chord is often the dominant, aka V7 and from that position it usually moves to the I chord. Some I chords are easier to reach than others.
Here are a few suggestions. The R indicates the root note of the chord. This makes it easy to build a chord on a particular note.</p>
